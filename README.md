# Lost-Articles-and-Letters-Reconciliation-System
A Post Office wants to improve its efficiency by delivering the lost letters and lost articles (which are sent in parcels) in a short period of time. Currently it takes about 3 months for a lost letter or a lost article to reach the correct destination. A machine reads addresses on letters. The ones, which could not be read by machine, are sorted by human intervention. Even after this, the address is not readable, it becomes a lost letter. Articles that fall out of the parcel become lost articles. When the sender/receiver calls up or contacts the post office for their letter/article, a manual note is made and then this note is sent to the warehouse where lost articles and lost letters are kept. The reconciliation process of  finding the lost letter/article is manual and sometimes wrong letter/article(s) is sent.  I have to develop a system, which captures the above functionality and reduce the turnaround time from 3 months to 10 working days. This is an Intranet application.
